Hello
This is the Coding test for Andrei Manolache

Quick notes for setting up this project:

- Please make sure you have php installed
- Please make sure you have composer installed
- please run composer install to obtain all the packages including PHPUnit
- I simply ran the project with this command : php -S localhost:8000

Quick notes about the project itself
- It can gain more from Unit testing each and every little thing, like for
example the Tranche model but to deliver this project in a timely manner I just
covered the test cases in the instructions

- No views were used since this was mainly a project design test but I did try
out my code along the way. To do that I used the FileParsing controller in
App/Controller. If you guys want a visual representation of the code running
just go to http://localhost:8000/invest after launching the local web server

- I like loggers to just know what's going on and if anything breaks or if
someone wants to access my page so I also added a logger in the Lib

- To save some time on most of my personal projects
 I do tend to reuse a project skeleton so please understand if I
 forgot any bits of code

 Don't hesitate to contact me at andrei.r.manolache@gmail.com for
 further details on this
