Hello
This is the Technical test for Andrei Manolache

Quick notes for setting up this project:

- Please make sure you have php installed
- Please make sure you have composer installed
- please run composer install to obtain all the packages including PHPUnit
- I simply ran the project with this command : php -S localhost:8000

Quick notes about the project itself

- No views were used since this was mainly a project design test but I did try
  out my code along the way. To do that I used the FileParsing controller in
  App/Controller. If you guys want a visual representation of the code running
  just go to http://localhost:8000/ after launching the local web server

- I like loggers to just know what's going on and if anything breaks or if
  someone wants to access my page so I also added a logger in the Lib

- To save some time on most projects (coding tests/pure php projects etc)
  I do tend to reuse a project skeleton

Don't hesitate to contact me at andrei.r.manolache@gmail.com for
further details on this
